PROJECT TITLE: Victor-Ika-THESIS

FOLDERS:

RAW DATA: This folder will contain all the unprocessed information I gathered from research and questionnaires passed out to students in the UWMadison Campus Area.
PROCESSED DATA: All the data processed and summarized into sections as appropriate. Appropriate groups are described and labeled.
FIGURES: This folder contains all my figures which include tables, pictures, graphs and any other visual representation of my research work.
TESTS-code: All the tests I did with my code and how my code was run and utilized will be put int this folder.
R: Since I used  R data to interpret and summarize my data, all my raw data from R and exports from that software will be in this folder.
SCRIPTS: All my scripts containing code history and current scripts in all programming languages used in this project will be here.
README.md: This contains the whole information relating to the project in a plain text file. All my data, it's history and how it was generated and the process of analysis.
I chose this setup for this project because it is simple to understand for both me and my instructor who will be regularly looking through my progress and making changes as necessary. This guide 
will let him know where to leave corrections and things to do on the project.
